# Analyzing Federal Investments in Ground Combat Systems Programs

This case study focuses on providing support and insights to the Deputy Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems within the Department of Defense (DoD). The objective is to examine prior federal investments in various ground combat systems (GCS) programs, specifically the Abrams tank (M1A1), Bradley fighting vehicle (M2A1), and Stryker armored personnel carrier (M1130), to identify contracting inefficiencies, opportunities for future investments, and potential risks associated with program management.
Addressing Data Pain Points:

1. Vendor Name Normalization: To address the issue of vendor name normalization, this study ensured consistency in vendor identification across contracts. This involved standardizing vendor names, and mapping those names to the original data set. This helps in reducing redundancy and improving data accuracy.
   
2. Misidentified or Unidentified GCS Contracts and Vendors: A comprehensive review of the dataset was completed to identify and rectify any misidentified or unidentified GCS contracts and vendors, ensuring a more complete and accurate analysis. To do this, GCS titles were categorized using their program name in various forms and their code.

# Methodology:
Our approach involved data cleaning, normalization, and organization to ensure data accuracy and consistency. We used Python code-based methods and data transformation techniques to enhance data quality and relevancy. Python data visualization libraries were used including
Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Assessment of Spending Trends and Key Insights:
In this analysis, federal contract data from FY16 to FY20 uncovered several key insights and trends:
1. Prominent Vendors: We identified the major vendors involved in GCS programs, highlighting their roles and contributions.
2. Funding/Contracting Offices: We examined the funding and contracting offices responsible for these programs, providing clarity on the financial and administrative aspects.
3. Agencies: We analyzed the agencies overseeing these contracts, shedding light on the interagency landscape.
